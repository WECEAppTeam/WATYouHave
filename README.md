WAT You Have
==========

Have you ever forgotten an item in the back of your fridge? Have you ever been a few days late reading an expiration label? Do you wish there was an easier way to know what will go bad soon rather than look through every food item you own?

WAT You Have is a mobile application engineered by Women in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Florida to keep track of Expired foods!
